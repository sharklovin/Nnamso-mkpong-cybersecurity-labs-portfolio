## Summary
Received an email with display name "Opensea" sent from `emails.dynamitestyle.com`. The message appears in the spam folder and contains tracking looking addresses in the Reply-To header. Initial header checks and link reputation checks were performed without clicking any links.

## Header summary
- From: `Opensea <info@emails.dynamitestyle.com>`  
- Reply-To: `Dynamite <reply-fe691572706502797715-...@emails.dynamitestyle.com>`  
- Mailed-by: `bounce.emails.dynamitestyle.com`  
- Signed-by: `emails.dynamitestyle.com`  
- Security: `Standard encryption (TLS)`

**Observations**
- Display name (Opensea) does not match sending domain. (Add pics)
- Message is likely from a third-party mailing service or a spoofed sender.  
- Transport encryption present but no indication of legitimate Opensea origin.

## Header analysis
- Display name shows it is from *Opensea* but email originates from `emails.dynamitestyle.com`.
- Legit senders generally use their corporate domains (e.g., `@opensea.io`).
- I checked my old emails from when I signed up for OpenSea and found their real website address. (add pics)
- **Conclusion:** The email address did not match. High suspicion of impersonation.

### 2. Reply-To and tracking-style address (reply to pics)
- Reply-To contains a long, tracking-looking address on the same suspicious domain.  
- Reply-To may route responses to attacker-managed inboxes and is commonly used by phishing campaigns to capture replies.  
- **Conclusion:** What i did was to keep the replies blocked and did not interact.

## Body and Link analysis (add body pic)
- The body content exhibits all classic social engineering patterns. Psychological Manipulation like 
  False Urgency: "Hurry", "won't last forever", "limited-time opportunity"

- I proceeded with a deeper investigation by extracting the actual embedded link from the email. I did this by opening the specific email, clicked the three vertical dots in the top-right corner, and selected "Show original" to access the raw email source code. I then located the body of the email and copied the URL hidden behind the "Access Now" button. Finally, I submitted this link to Virus Total for analysis, which confirmed the domain was malicious and flagged by a security vendor.

## Findings / Conclusion
- The email emails.dynamitestyle.com is suspicious for impersonation and should be treated as phishing.  
- Recommended steps: mark as phishing, block sender domain in mail filters.
- No evidence of successful compromise has been found at this time.
