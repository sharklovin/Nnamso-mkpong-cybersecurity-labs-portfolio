## Objective
Review the results of a network vulnerability scan and interpret the findings to develop a remediation plan.
---

### Summary of Scan
The scan was conducted against a controlled AWS target using **Nessus Essentials** with the **Basic Network Scan** policy.  
All identified vulnerabilities were informational (no critical, high, or medium findings).

# Scan Results and Analysis
- All detected items were of Informational severity. These do not pose immediate threats but provide valuable insights into the system’s exposure.**

# Remediation Plan
The goal is to reduce exposure and harden the AWS instance by minimizing the information revealed during reconnaissance.


**Phase 1: Immediate Hardening (Low Effort, High Impact)**

- Finding: nginx server banner exposure (Plugin 10107)
- Action: Disable or modify the server banner in Nginx.
- Rationale: Prevents attackers from identifying the exact version and potential vulnerabilities.
- Priority: High

- Finding: Service banner exposure (Plugin 22964)
- Action: Configure SSH and other services to limit visible version information.
- Rationale: Reduces system fingerprinting accuracy.
- Priority: Medium

---

**Phase 2: Patch & Update Assessment

- Findings: Missing credentialed checks (Plugins 110723, 117886)
- Action: Reconfigure Nessus with valid SSH credentials.
- Rationale: Enables authenticated scanning for deeper vulnerability insight.
- Priority: High

---

**Phase 3: Firewall and Access Control Review
- Action: Review AWS Security Group rules to ensure only required ports (22, 80) are open to trusted IPs.
- Rationale: Implements the principle of least privilege.
- Priority: Medium

---

Conclusion

This exercise demonstrated a complete vulnerability management workflow in a cloud environment — scanning, analysis, prioritization, remediation, and verification.

Even though the initial Nessus scan reported only informational findings, the AWS instance was revealing too much system detail. By obscuring banners and reviewing security group rules, the host’s attack surface was effectively reduced.
