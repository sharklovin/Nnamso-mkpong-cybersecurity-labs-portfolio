# Objective
- To conduct a comprehensive risk assessment and develop a risk management framework for an educational institution's IT infrastructure, demonstrating practical application of NIST risk management principles in a real world scenario, which is my mom's IT LAB.

---

**Organization Chosen:** Marri Gold Internation School
**Critical Business Process:** Operation of Marri Gold International IT Lab

# Identified Risks:

- **Ransomware/Malware Infection:** A student accidentally downloads malware or plugs in an infected USB drive, destroying lab computers.

- **Hardware Failure/Theft:** Theft of expensive computers, projectors, or other equipment. Or a critical component like the server or network switch fails.

- **Inappropriate Content Access:** Students bypass filters to access violent, explicit, or otherwise harmful online content.

- **Network Outage:** The internet connection or local network fails, rendering the lab unusable for online activities.

- **Damage to Equipment:** Accidental or intentional physical damage to computers, keyboards, or monitors by students.

- **Power Surge/Outage:** A power fluctuation or outage damages hardware or corrupts data.

# Based on this Lab exercise, one risk will be chosen for a Qualitative Risk Assessment.
**Chosen Risk for Assessment:** 
- Number 1: Ransomware/Malware Infection

**Qualitative Risk Assessment:**

- Risk: A student accidentally downloads malware or plugs in an infected USB drive, destroying lab computers.

- Threat Source: The students via unauthorized downloads or games and Cybercriminal groups via malicious sites and ads.

- Vulnerability: Lack of strong antivirus, unpatched operating systems/software, students having unnecessary admin rights, lack of user education.

- Likelihood: It can get from Medium to High. Students are curious and may click on suspicious links or use unauthorized software. The environment is a prime target for opportunistic malware.

- Impact: High.

- Operational: The entire lab could get unusable for days. Lessons are halted, and scheduled tests are disrupted.

- Financial: Cost of IT support to clean or re-image all machines. Potential cost of data recovery.

- Data Loss: Loss of student projects, teaching materials, and local software config.

- Reputational: Parents and staff could lose confidence in the school's ability to provide a safe, reliable learning environment  for their child.

- Overall Risk Level: High. The high likelihood combined with a high operational impact creates a serious risk that must be addressed.

## Risk Management

Risk:  A student accidentally downloads malware or plugs in an infected USB drive, destroying lab computers.

**Strategy and Application**

- Strategy: Risk Mitigation
- Application:
1. Installing next generation antivirus, disabling USB boot in BIOS, and blocking all executable files from USB drives
2. Implement system imaging for rapid recovery and also student digital literacy training
3. Physical: Always use USB port locks for younger students
---
- Strategy: Risk Avoidance
- Application: Completely ban all external USB devices and block student download capabilities on lab computers.
---

- Strategy: Risk Acceptance  
- Application: After implementing antivirus, USB controls, and system imaging, accept the residual risk that zero day malware might occasionally bypass these controls-

---
- Strategy: Risk transference	
- Application: Purchase insurance or outsource data hosting to a secure cloud provider.

---

The most appropriate strategy would be risk mitigation and transference.
